# N-Body-Simulation
##### The purpose of this program is to simulate the motion of N particles in the plane, mutually affected by gravitational forces, and animate the results. Such methods are widely used in cosmology, semiconductors, and fluid dynamics to study complex physical systems. Scientists also apply the same techniques to other pairwise interactions including Coulombic, Biot-Savart, and van der Waals.
##### The specification for this program were as follow:
  * Reads two double command-line arguments T and Î”t.
  * Reads in the universe from standard input
  * Simulates the universe, starting at time t = 0.0, and continuing as long as t < T.
  * Animates the results to standard drawing.
  * Prints the state of the universe at the end of the simulation (in the same format as the input file).
